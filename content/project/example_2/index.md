## Overview

The GAI measures changes in social acceptance to LGBT people and issues in 175 countries. The Global Acceptance Index (GAI) uses data from more than 2,750 surveys conducted over 30 years and provides each nation with a score of 0 to 10 to indicate their level of acceptance. (Flores 2021)
