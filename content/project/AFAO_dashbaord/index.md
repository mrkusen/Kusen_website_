## Overview

As part of the Sustainability of Key Population HIV Services across Asia program (SKPA2) baseline assessment, a sustainability pulse check was developed and conducted online using Google Forms. The survey engaged a cross-section of key stakeholders from the four countries and responses have been received from 60 stakeholders. The survey was designed to support both baseline and end of project needs, and indicators can be disaggregated by country, objective and stakeholder group (governments, civil society organizations, key populations, and multilateral organisations.) 


## Data Visualization 

Data collected was analyzed throughout the process, with fact-checking and verification occurring where required. Survey results were analyzed using R and Power BI for dashboard development. Dashboard results can be accessed online. https://www.afao.org.au/our-work/international-program/dashboard/ . The dashboard that I developed included an overview tab of who provided information as well as 5 tabs related to each of the objectives of the program. Data can be filtered by country and the type of stakeholder in the dashboard.
