## Overview

Freedom in the World, Freedom Houseâ€™s flagship publication, is the standard-setting comparative assessment of global political rights and civil liberties. Published annually since 1972, the survey ratings and narrative reports on 195 countries and 15 related and disputed territories are used by policymakers, the media, international corporations, civic activists, and human rights defenders.

## Data Visualization 

Using data from the Freedom in the World, I have created some graphs and geospatial visualizations mapping freedom score and freedom ranking over the years by country and continent. 

Please see link for slides for all data visualization and reproducible R code is provided via GitHub.
